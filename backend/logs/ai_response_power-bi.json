    },
    {
      "question_text": "To create a measure that shows the percentage of total sales for each product, what DAX pattern would you typically use",
      "options": ["DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), SUM(Sales[Amount])) without context modification", "DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALL(Sales)))", "SUM(Sales[Amount]) / COUNTROWS(Sales)", "CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(ALL(Sales), Sales[Product] = CURRENTITEM()))"],

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "To calculate a percentage of total, you need the current item's value divided by the grand total. ALL(Sales) removes all filters from the Sales table, giving you the grand total for the denominator."

      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "RLS allows you to define roles and rules using DAX filters that restrict which rows of data a user can see. When a user logs in, the RLS rules are applied, filtering the data visible to them."

      "options": ["Filter context applies to individual rows while row context applies to the entire table", "Filter context is created by visuals and slicers, while row context is created by iterating functions", "They are interchangeable terms for the same concept", "Row context is only for calculated columns, filter context is only for measures"],
      "correct_answer": "Filter context is created by visuals and slicers, while row context is created by iterating functions",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Filter context describes the set of filters applied to a calculation e.g. by slicers, visuals. Row context is created when DAX functions iterate over a table e.g. SUMX, FILTER and evaluates an expression for each row."
    },
    {
      "question_text": "Your Power BI report is performing slowly. Which of the following is NOT a common optimization technique for improving report performance",
      "options": ["Reducing the number of rows and columns in the data model", "Optimizing complex DAX measures", "Using more high-cardinality columns in filters", "Choosing appropriate storage modes e.g. Import vs DirectQuery"],
      "correct_answer": "Using more high-cardinality columns in filters",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "Using more high-cardinality columns columns with many unique values in filters or visuals can often degrade performance, as it increases the complexity of filtering and aggregation. Optimization usually involves reducing cardinality where possible or using efficient filtering strategies."
    },
    {
      "question_text": "When would you typically choose DirectQuery over Import mode for a Power BI dataset, and what is a significant limitation of DirectQuery",
      "options": ["Choose DirectQuery for smaller datasets and its limitation is faster refresh times", "Choose DirectQuery for real-time data needs or very large datasets, but its limitation is slower query performance", "Choose DirectQuery for complex DAX calculations and its limitation is limited data sources", "Choose DirectQuery for offline access and its limitation is no security features"],
      "correct_answer": "Choose DirectQuery for real-time data needs or very large datasets, but its limitation is slower query performance",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "DirectQuery is suitable when data needs to be real-time or the dataset is too large to fit into memory Import mode. However, it generally results in slower query performance compared to Import mode because every interaction with the report triggers a query back to the source database."
    },
    {
      "question_text": "What is the purpose of the 'Summarization' property for columns in Power BI, and when might you change it from the default",
      "options": ["It defines how text columns are sorted and should be changed for alphabetical order", "It determines the default aggregation behavior of a column in visuals and should be changed for non-additive measures", "It controls the visibility of a column in the report view and should be changed to hide sensitive data", "It specifies the data type of a column and should be changed for numerical precision"],
      "correct_answer": "It determines the default aggregation behavior of a column in visuals and should be changed for non-additive measures",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "The Summarization property e.g. Sum, Average, Count, Do Not Summarize dictates how a column will aggregate by default when dragged into a visual. You would change it from the default often Sum for numbers for columns that represent non-additive values like unit price, which should be averaged or identifiers which should be counted or not summarized."

    {
      "question_text": "Describe the difference between a many-to-many relationship created directly in Power BI Desktop and one created using a bridge table. Which approach is generally preferred and why",
      "options": ["Direct many-to-many is faster but less flexible; bridge table is slower but more flexible. Direct is preferred for simplicity.", "Direct many-to-many can be ambiguous and less performant; a bridge table provides clear filtering paths and better performance. The bridge table approach is generally preferred for clarity and control.", "Direct many-to-many is only for small datasets; bridge table is for large datasets. Direct is preferred for ease of setup.", "There is no functional difference; they are just different ways to achieve the same result. Neither is preferred."],
      "correct_answer": "Direct many-to-many can be ambiguous and less performant; a bridge table provides clear filtering paths and better performance. The bridge table approach is generally preferred for clarity and control.",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "explanation": "A direct many-to-many relationship in Power BI can sometimes lead to ambiguous filter propagation and performance issues. A bridge table or junction table explicitly models the many-to-many relationship as two one-to-many relationships, providing clear filter context, better performance, and more control over DAX calculations, making it the generally preferred approach."
